# Global AI Nights Sept 2019
Intermediate Track - Part 2 Crash course on building and accelerating deep learning solutions
<br/>
<br/>
Learn the end to end process of building deep learning solutions from experimentation to deployment. We will start by experimenting locally with different model architectures and hyperparameters using PyTorch. Then, weâ€™ll show you how to use Azure Machine Learning service to train models at massive scale in the cloud and seamlessly deploy them into production.
