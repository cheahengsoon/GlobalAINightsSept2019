# Global AI Night Sept 2019
Intermediate Track - Part 2 Crash course on building and accelerating deep learning solutions
<br/>
<br/>
Learn the end to end process of building deep learning solutions from experimentation to deployment. We will start by experimenting locally with different model architectures and hyperparameters using PyTorch. Then, weâ€™ll show you how to use Azure Machine Learning service to train models at massive scale in the cloud and seamlessly deploy them into production.
<br/>
<br/>
Part 1 - Getting familiar with Deep Learning and PyTorch (start.html)<br/>
Part 2 - Using Azure Machine Learning service to cloud accelerate deep learning (clould.html)
- Import the project from https://github.com/sethjuarez/pytorchintro
- Create Machine Learning service workspace in Microsoft Azure Portal
- Go to Azure Notebooks and change the environments : Requirements, requirement.txt and Python 3.6
- Click the cloud.ipynb
- Go to Kernel > Change Kernel > Python 3.6
- Download config.json file from Machine Learning Service Workspace and import to your Azure Notebooks.
- Remember to change the VM Size to vm_size='Standard_DS15_v2' in Cloud Compute section.
